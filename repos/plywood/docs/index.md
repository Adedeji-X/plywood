Plywood is a cross-platform open source C++ framework. It was originally developed to support a game engine, but you can use it to build other kinds of software, too. For example, the website you're visiting right now runs on Plywood.

Plywood is released under the [MIT License]() and supports Windows, Linux and macOS.

Plywood consists of three main components:

1. A **workspace** designed to help you reuse code between applications.
2. A set of **built-in modules** providing cross-platform I/O, containers, process creation and more.
3. A runtime **reflection** and serialization system.

To get started using Plywood, follow the instructions on the [Quick Start]() page, then try [Building the Documentation]().

This documentation is still a work in progress. Some of Plywood's built-in modules have been documentated and some have not. For now, you can browse what's available using the table of contents on the left.

For any questions or feedback, join the discussion on [the Plywood Discord server](https://discord.gg/WnQhuVF)!
